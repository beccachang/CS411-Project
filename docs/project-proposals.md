**Project Proposal #1**

For our first proposal, we will require the user to input a date and optionally a country. Then we will use the Wikipedia API to pull a list of events that occurred on that day or month in said country. Then we will use the YouTube API to suggest videos related to the returned events and also use the Spotify API to return the top 50 songs from the month and year. To use our application, the user must create an account and login. The user data will be stored in a database.

**Project Proposal #2**

For our second proposal, we will require the user to input a type of food that they want/are interested in. We will use a recipe API (Tasty, Spoonacular, Yummly, Zomato,) to generate a recipe. After the user receives their recipe, we will use the YouTube API to suggest videos and Instagram API to suggest relevant content. To use our application, the user must create an account and login. The user data will be stored in a database.
