# Technology Stack
For the frontend, we used React instead of Angular or Vue because two of our members had some React experience. None of us had Angular or Vue experience.

For the backend, we chose Django because everyone was familiar with Python, and because it came automatically with a database configured. We chose not to use Node because we did not have much JavaScript experience.
