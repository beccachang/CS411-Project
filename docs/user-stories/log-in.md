**Log In**

As a registered user, I want to be able to log in with an existing username and password. On the main page of the application, there is a button that will direct the user to create a profile or log in to the app. Upon clicking the button, the user should see the ways of signing in using Open Authorization (OAuth) via Google. The user must have an existing account on Google to continue. Alternatively, they may create an account with Google and then return to our application to log in. The user enters the login information to one of these accounts. Then the user clicks a submit button.
If the login is successful, then the user should be directed to the main page for logged in users where dates can be searched.

If the login is not successful, an error should be displayed and the app should redirect the user back to the login page to try logging in again.
