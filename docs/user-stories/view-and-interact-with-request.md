**View and Interact with Request Response**

As a logged in user, I want to be able to view and interact with the request response. After the user has submitted their request (see Submit Date Request story), they will be redirected to a dashboard page with all the data displayed (Wikipedia, Spotfy). 

If the submission was valid, but one component of the results (Wikipedia articles, YouTube videos) could not be found, the results that were found will still be on the page. The dashboard will convey to the user which of the sources did not yield results to their search. If no results could be found on any of the searched platforms, then the application will state that no results could be found.

Youtube and Wikipedia data will be displayed side to side.
