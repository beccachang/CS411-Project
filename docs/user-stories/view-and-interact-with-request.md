*View and Interact with Request Response*

As a logged in user, I want to be able to view and interact with the request response. After the user has submitted their request (see Submit Date and Country Request story), they will be redirected to a dashboard page with all the data displayed (Wikipedia, Spotfy, Youtube). 

If the submission was valid, but one component of the results (Wikipedia articles, YouTube videos, Spotify songs) could not be found, the results that were found will still be on the page. The dashboard will convey to the user which of the sources did not yield results to their search. If no results could be found on any of the searched platforms, then the application will state that no results could be found.

Spotify data will be displayed on the right column. The songs will be listed under buttons for the functions of play/pause, skip forward, skip backward. The user should be able to click the buttons to use their specific functions. 

Youtube data will be displayed in the center of the screen and should be the most relevant to their search. The user should be able to click the video and have it play directly on the website. 

Wikipedia data will be displayed under the youtube content and should be links to relevant articles. These links should be clickable and direct the user to the article.
